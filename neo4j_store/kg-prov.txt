Couldn't possibly  imagine a better experience. Wish I had found them earlier for my first injury. Going to start with them for a separate issue now. (did you know you don't need a doctor to order physical therapy?  You can just call and they will hook you up!!!) P.S. If you are a runner and having any issues at all..don't wait. These guys will help you understand the issue and give you the tools you need to fix it!"]
[ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdnV6dFFBEAE; reviewBody; "My review apparently got deleted but ill write this again. ABSOLUTELY, DO NOT GO TO THIS HOSPITAL FOR HELP. YOU WILL COME OUT WORSE THEN WHEN YOU WALKED IN. Thes staff are very rude, there's absolutely no therapy, and you get no treatment here. There was a grown man who walked in on me on three other woman naked and made inappropriate comments and we all made a complaint and they still had the same male staff at the same unit with us. The psychiatrist barely sees you, they change your medicine without telling you. This hospital visit has guaranteed me to not seek help from this place ever again."]
[ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHbHB2cnBnRRAB; reviewBody; "YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE PROPER TREATMENT HERE. I was in the waiting room for 36 hours straight, only allowed to sit in one spot. The CRC staff AND the supervisors are dismissive and disrespectful. I was moved to 3 different units while being admitted in the matter of 7 days where I had to see a totally new set of doctors and social workers each time. The hospital is so unorganized and the staff continuously violates HIPAA law. My mental health declined after being there. I felt so invisible and helpless and they set it up so that you cannot have any real advocates. They DO NOT allow ANY visitation due to Covid but I firmly believe it’s because they don’t want people to know what truly goes on behind closed doors. The staff in the security office will smile in your face and make you believe your loved one is in a good place while the patients are all getting ABUSED. I unfortunately couldn’t leave until a doctor agreed. The Patients’ rights that they have written on paper do not match up with what they do. The experience was honestly TRAUMATIC for the lack of a better word. They give you strong sleep meds and don’t offer talk therapy. if you don’t comply they threaten you with keeping you there longer. This hospital is a maze that you can’t get out of unless you are strong minded and unfortunately they take advantage of people with these issues. I am hoping someday there will be a change and more awareness of hospitals like these. Please get better staff and evaluate the way that you run this place! Too many people’s lives are in the hands of this hospital that feels more like a holding cell. Do not settle for this place."]

She said very rudely \"No I'm unfortunately too busy to do that ma'am.\" As someone that works in the mental health field, that is awful.. you should never be too busy to let your patients know that they have support on the outside contacting them. Please don't send your loved ones here. They don't apparently have the time to care for them properly."]

I joined therapy to have someone to express my woes, thoughts  feelings of being a single black mother. Last Thursday was my third or fourth session even meeting with my therapist and I shared with her that sometimes I have trouble taking care of myself with my depression, further explained that I make sure I take care of my daughter but whenever I am baby free I am depressed and not taking care of myself and then it’s pretty much me wearing the same clothes everyday and that I have food for my daughter to eat but due to my diet restrictions as a pescatarian, I don’t have anything for me to eat. (Sorry to shared my personal business like that but it’s the truth we’ve all been there.) My therapist offered to share some resources to help me with my situation such as Mazzoni Centers Food Bank, and then next thing I know knock I get DHS sent to my house. Dhs explained that they went to two addresses as an attempt before they got to mine and that I will now be assigned a caseworker. My therapist lied to me when I confronted her saying that I was supposed to get a phone call when the form I am reading stated an unscheduled visit. Why? Because a single black mother vented to her and now my words were taken and misconstrued into lack of supervision of my daughter. I don’t even know where they even got lack of supervision from. I am outraged and deserve justice for my daughter and I because now there is an open investigation on my peaceful household and due to the miscommunication from DHS I kept my daughter home from daycare thinking they would come visit her so that we could resolve this FALSE REPORT AND SLANDER WHICH AFFECTED  to work from home that day due to this inconvenience. I was lied to and my trust was broken. My advice is to get a journal and never trust a therapist from Mazzoni Center because they will come and try to snatch your baby if you’re going through a hard time. I wanted to share this story for any other BLACK SINGLE MOTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN IN MY POSITION AND I WANT TO PREVENT THIS EVER HAPPENING TO ANOTHER FAMILY AGAIN. My daughters father is outraged, my family is confused, and most importantly it FEELS like I will NEVER HEAL because Mazzoni Center made me stop trusting therapy, I will be contacting everyone I can to spread truth. If you are a single black woman and part of the LGBTQ+ community DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE THEY JUST WANT TO BREAK FAMILIES APART AND LOCK YOU UP FOR VENTING. What I said WAS NOT A RED FLAG OR WARNING SIGN TO GET OUTSIDE FORCES INVOLVED AND I FEEL AS THOUGH A HIPPA LAW WAS BROKEN. Please protect yourself and your children from this nightmare they call a help center. They help break apart families and break your trust!! I just pray that my family stays together and strong through this difficult time."""]

IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE 0 STARS I WOULDI admitted myself at this location last week. I waited in that waiting room for 18 hours just to get a bed. The waiting room was truly purgatory and seen and heard terrible things. Once I got my room I felt more relaxed at ease and comfortable.  Food was served and food was edible. Bed was okay, but where I truly seen the horrible experience was the staff to patient relationship. Staff straight up mistreated some patients and the enviorment was not safe what so ever. I will be openly saying names of patients and if I could name staff I would but they didn't want to disclose their names prior to being discharged. There was a 31 yo patient that was definately on the slower spectrum. His name is Giovanni. Gio was an innocent person who can't form sentences, can't write his name, and even forgets name quickly. I grew a friendship with him very quickly because of how comfortable he felt coming to me and talking to me about just anything. During my stay he got physically abused by another patient named Marcel. I do not blame Marcel for his actions for he is troubled as well. What my problem was the staff. There was one gentlement that worked there with long dreads and about 5'8 and wore Jordan retro 6s. He didn't want to disclose his name to me at all. He would openly talk bad about the patients, said that they stank, and didn't show hospitality to the patients. Giovanni wanted to use the bathroom and he had the audacity to say that Gio always needs to use the bathroom in a very negative tone. Where it ticked me off was the last day I was there. I had 1 hour before being discharged and Marcel started doing threatening gestures to giovanni. Like I said my problem isn't with Marcel as I said he is troubled himself. This nurse was joking with Marcel in sign language about giovanni and didn't take the threats  that Marcel was doing seriously. I confronted this nurse about the situation and he replied to me \"I don't care!\" I replied to his response with \"why do you work here?\" He obviously had nothing to say and I told the nurse to grow compassion for the patients. He gave the look that he truly didn't care at all. I just want to share this because nobody deserved to be mistreated at this place regardless of their mental state.

They got gangsta wannabe who act like prison guards in there. I have never been to prison or had a drug problem. But, inherently there, they treat you as if your homelessness is a result of you being in and out of the system your entire life. The owners are worthless and do nothing to help, unless you are recovery. So, I should've pretended I had a drug problem before I went in there. The case manager is a jokeHe does absolutely nothing except give you printouts while telling you that the funding is dried upThat counselor enjoys free paychecks while doing nothing at allHad a staff member step on my feet amd threatened me with violence.  The case worker never helped in that matter. Same staff member broke HIPPA protocols by telling many people about my medical historyI have traveled through 20 countries and this is one of the worst places i have ever seen"""]

On a previous stay, I kind of just showed up.... and 11 hours later, I was finally admitted. 11 hours and a bologna sandwichI don't usually complain about hospital food. It's food, within an institution. It's not going to be 5 star. However, without knowing for certain, I'm thinking prisoners get better food than this. Always cold. Always gross. Unless it's a holiday. Then, they actually serve hot food that is very edible. But, like last time, I had to ask the doctor for supplement shakes. Because, I (Like many others), don't do well without some version of food. Seriously. Just serve salads and sandwiches Friends. We'd all be better off. Or don't bring the food up and let it sit for an hour before servingI liked the groups. It's why I picked this hospital a second time around. Some staff, however, were a-holes and make me wonder why we are allowed to express concerns during the first and last groups.... when we do and are reprimanded for it. Also, we are adults and prefer to watch something above the grade of cartoons sometimes. I'm not asking for rated R here. No need for rape scenes and such. But again, WE ARE ADULTSMy social worker, yet again, didn't really social work. I say yet again, because they either seem to do their job well (Brooke Glenn on Close Ops) or they see you on your last day and that's it (Brooke Glenn different unit/Horsham Clinic... same woman). I'm the one who had to call my Psychiatrist's office to schedule an appointment. Said it wasn't something she did. Really? Listen people. Your social worker, is supposed to set up after care for you. Don't listen to or tolerate that crap. And, when they give you a shi**y explanation to cover their tracks, complain. It's the only way WE get heardOh. When I left I stayed in contact with a fellow patient. Who informed me they found mold in the patient water dispenser and had a problem with bed bugsSo, the only reason this place gets any stars at all, is the groups. And, the fact the doctor apologized to me. Never had a doctor make a mistake and fess up to it. Which earns at least 1 star in my book."""]

[ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCM2ZyVmpRRRAB; reviewBody; """Hace como 3 meses aquí en el albergue dirigido por Resources For Human Development (RHD por sus siglas en inglés) nos hicieron una reunión de emergencia dónde tuvimos que tomar nuestras pertenencias básicas y salir corriendo (literalmente) de el edificio en dónde estábamos llamado Fernwood. Este Supervisor Regional nos informó que teníamos que abandonar el edificio INMEDIATAMENTE. Este caballero nos dijo y cito sus palabras : \"Yo no dejaría a mis hijos estar ni un solo día aquí\". Cuando le pregunté el motivo del porqué, me ignoro y cambio el tema. Nos mudaron para un comedor adyacente al complejo (que una vez fue un hogar de ancianos) y nos pusieron todos juntos como sardinas en este comedor. Yo soy bien observador y veo que a los siguientes días vino un equipo de demolición a trabajar en ese edificio del que nos sacaron. Pues resulta que el lugar estaba contaminado con black mold y quién sabe que más. Pues saben qué? En el \"nuevo\" edificio también lo hay y tengo fotos. No tan solo lo hay si no que lo trataron de tapar pintando de blanco sobre las superficies, especialmente por donde están los respiradores del aire acondicionado. Osea tapando el problema no resolviendoloPues ahora resulta que hicieron unas pruebas de Covid y alrededor de 23 personas incluyendo mujeres dimos positivo al mismo. Nuevamente vinieron corriendo y nos movieron a un edificio donde \"compartimos\" el baño con mujeres. De que si necesito hacer mis necesidades tengo que tocar la puerta y si hay una dama esperar a qué ella termine para ENTONCES yo hacer mis necesidades si es que no me las he hecho encima esperando. No hay NADIE tomando el tiempo y regulando que sea justo para todos. No hay fuente de agua limpia para beber y TODAS las duchas solo tienen agua fría (la temperatura afuera está a 44° osea se pueden imaginar cómo sale de fría). Solo las bañeras tiene agua caliente pero no tienen ducha. Ayer me bañé con un vasito. Y está quien no se baña porque no quiere (y/o no puede por condiciones de salud) o son impedidos, pero está quien no le importa. La comida nos la traen fría y una cantidad que da vergüenza siendo esto una entidad supervisada y controlada por la ciudad de Philadelphia. Nos tienen en cuarentena 4 personas dentro de una misma habitación. Y honestamente Yo ni se al 100% si estoy positivo o no pues no me dieron mis resultados. Solo vinieron alarmados con una prisa extrema para que agarraramos lo que \"necesitamos\" por 5 días que dura la cuarentena (aparentemente). Aaaaah! Pero si doy positivo en 5 dias me quedo aquí 5 días más. Pero me come por dentro esa seguridad de que me dicen que me voy en 5 días. Y adivinen qué? En vez de hacer pruebas mandatorias a todo el mundo inmediatamente ya le informaron al resto de los residentes que se harán dichas pruebas...el Lunes. Pq el Lunes? Pq si las hacen hoy no hay espacio suficiente en el edificio para tanta gente que Yo estoy súper seguro están positivasQue cosas no???🙄🤔🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️😠Entre varias irregularidades más. Staffs power tripping, seguridad guillaos de Policías y faltase personal, poca limpieza e higiene entre otras muchas cosasPero así mismo es uno de los albergues menos malos en la ciudad. No sé que hacen con los fondos por parte de quienes se suponen los provean. 🤔"""]

I have been to 3 mental facilities, with this one included, and it was by-far the worst one i’ve seen. I had stayed here for around two weeks, and it was easily one of the most traumatizing experiences i’ve had overall in hospitals. And thats saying a lot, considering a good amount of my trauma stems from hospitalization. Anyways, onto the parts of it that make it bad, the staff. There were two staff members i liked. Two. And not even loved, just… liked. There was one staff member, who i will not be naming along with all the others, as i don’t wish to do such, who had literally ripped the head off of a 13 year old girl’s stuffed animal. Ripped it off. All because she was kissing some other girl. First of all, that’s, at the very least to my knowledge, illegal, and second off, morally really bad. There was another staff member, who i am so very tempted to name simply because she was honestly the worst. She would yell and abuse her power as a nurse to get her way, and then say it’s just her personality. She was not fit to be working in a mental hospital, and i stand by that. I would quite honestly rather go through what i was going through when i was first entered into a hospital again, without any support or therapy, than go back to this hospital. Overall, if your kid, or you, cannot deal with loud noises, fighting, yelling, extreme stress, and things such as this, I would highly recommend not going here."]

Let’s just say I went in last October and I was really disoriented and was not myself so that weird waiting room was like a breeze. As soon as I went upstairs now that was a different story. The staff there smh. Anyone can get a job there. I was in for a total of 10 days. Only because I pleaded for my release after I was harmed by another patient I won’t mention his name my face was horrible. I spoke to2 psychiatrist 1 a woman and the second a male I made him promise to release me. When I was released my husbands wedding band went missing and cash as well. I was paranoid upon entering so I kept all of my jewelry and iPhones iwatch cash etc in the safe. For some reason they opened it laughed showed me. Catalogued my items I saw my wedding bands all 3 but my cash was completely gone and that’s why I went in there in the first place because I was doing things I normally wouldn’t do so to stop spending I voluntarily checked myself in thinking and believing I was in good hands. That was a complete understatement. I suffered. I was told to come back 6 months after treatment to seek a job there. And I’m tempted to because I want the pati To be treated respectfully and with dignity. I have seen a lot enough to have that place shut down but I don’t because most are seeking shelter and food and a connection to other patients. I get it. But it’s a facility where no one should ever feel they want to run away from because it’s f the lack of care. I was in my own world. I later found out I was dehydrated and my blood count was low and blood pressure was uneven that’s why I felt the way I felt in the first place. Why I just didn’t go to the hospital I don’t know why.

Their reply was very positive and advised me that I would be accommodated.  My immediate impression of the facility upon arrival was very positive. The first person I interacted with couldn't have been more pleasant. She directed me to the emergency room where I was immediately registered as a traveling vet and escorted into a room for vitals and to await my visit with a doctor.  Both the triage nurse and the doctor were pleasant and accommodated my needs in a timely fashion. I was supplied with authorization to receive my insulin from the pharmacy. I then proceeded to pharmacy and was greeted by a friendly pharmacy tech who quickly expedited my prescription. In total, the entire time spent at the hospital spanned a whopping 30 minutes. In summary, I would Rate my experience with full stars and based on my experience, would recommend the Philadelphia VA to any traveling vet with similar needs as mine.

I even through the years ask doctors why they put up with nasty staff & they all said, do you have any idea how hard it's to fire a VA employee no matter how bad they are! Compared to a VA like Coatesville there is no comparison because that VA treats Vets great & dose all they can do for a Vet & want to do it. Unlike the Philly VA medical center it's like you're bothering them. Plus you can Never personally talk to your doctor there, other than actually going in person to see the doctor there is no emailing them on myheathvet either. There is no messaging them or talking to their nurse, well, that is because \"almost\" all of them are Penn doctors there over across the street at Penn U you can actually talk to the same doctors.

This place is amazing, from the service to the people i have never received anything but 110% from everyone to help me in any way i needed. The location is very clean and your wait is never long, in a time where this kind of medical care is not always affordable they have made it easy to maintain your personal and sexual health without the stress of cost. The Mazzoni center is a great example of how healthcare and the public should be treated. Bravo"]

[ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURaLU4tQ1lREAE; reviewBody; """I saw the reviews here and took a chance at staying here, and I entirely understand the wide spectrum in terms of reviewsI'll start by repeating what I've said to numerous people, including employees, family, and friends: you will only be treated with respect if you are coherent, calm, and complacent. All qualities not generally found in a place meant for emergency treatment for mental illnessI suppose I was lucky, with my situation coinciding with those three qualities. I won't discredit anyone's experience here, positive or otherwise, but I personally would not recommend Friends Hospital if you need genuinely anything more than a place to stay away from your current situation and are capable enough to keep yourself safe to a certain degreeWhile I was there, I experienced both ends of the human compassion spectrum, from a technician helping me contact a family member daily, to being flatly ignored when asking for items (such as my daily hygiene bag in the evenings) multiple times. I also experienced medications being given to me that were not prescribed by the psychiatrist, and witnessed emotional and verbal (sometimes physical) abuse between patients and staff alike. I am aware that mental health services as a career is draining and taxing, but I also believe that the career choice should not be taken lightly, especially by those who actively complain that other places offer more money for better hoursIn the hallway, there's a poster that details what a usual day looks like in terms of activities, all on a weekly cycle. Oftentimes, this schedule was not followed. An hour of outdoors time was not offered every day as it should have been, much less actually provided. If we did have groups, they were not done as often as it was supposed to, and the technician-led groups just did not happen. There were two choice instances where the technician-led group time slots were used, but both times were led by patients insteadThe only truly kind and friendly people I encountered were those who did not deal with patients on a constant basis, such as nurses, medical students, social workers, and admin staff. If it weren't for them, I might've done something drastic when I got homeIn all, this was absolutely not the best facility I've stayed at, and I would not recommend it to anyone who isn't excellent at pretending they are fine when at the absolute end of their rope. If you are angry, upset, confused, or anything besides calm and mildly sad, you will be met with disrespect and borderline contempt by the general staff. I truly hope that the hospital takes any and all complaints seriously, as the potential for a healing environment is there, it's just hidden under deep layers of apathy and dismissal."""]

I love every bit of it to. I'm only a two minute walk to there office in Olney. And Only two blocks from the Septa Subway. They come and  make home visits every two weeks or so, to just check up , which usually is only for about fifteen minutes or so. So not so bad . If you have any questions about anything just ask Pathways . They most of the time have the answers you might be looking for .

At the end of LAST YEAR (2021), I received a bill from a collections agency saying that Mazzoni had filed a claim that I owed them. In 2020. Close to a literal decade after being a patientI live in Jersey now and when I had my first appointment with my new primary care doctor, I got an STI screening. Upon receiving my results, both my doctor and myself were confused by a positive test. After some research, conversations, and more doctors appointments, I found out that Mazzoni gave me an “incomplete” round of treatment for a particular STI, according to the employee at the department of health who called me to go over my options. The stigma behind STIs is already heavy enough without an establishment like Mazzoni making literally everything worse by taking shortcuts, and Philadelphia’s queer community suffers for it."""]

Its proximity to the VA Hospital allows residents to continue on with pursuing treatment and care, its proximity to local transportation afford residents to step out and see the city. The program also affords its residents that comply with the set rules to regain their sense of self-worth and become an active member to society.

I was 3 months pregnant when I went in but had no idea because I was only worried about using. State regulations state that facilities that medically detox women within child bearing years MUST test them before starting detox and educate them on their options and what would be best. They NEVER told me I was pregnant. They medically detoxed me with subutex and didn't test to see if I was pregnant. They were also just starting the renovations to the detox area while I was there (March 2015) and someone asked a tech how they can afford this after just building the resident houses, the techs reply was \"the heroin epidemic, we are rolling in money from you guys\".... As true as that may be, its a disgusting thing to say to a patient in your facility. Now I've been an addict for 5 years before coming here and had been in and out of rehabs but this was the first time I was so disgusted with a place. I clearly know I have a problem, they told me after being reviewed and talked to, they didn't feel I needed long term treatment and that a 5 day detox was good enough! I looked at my councelor in disgust and told her no I can't be sent back out their I'm telling you I will pick up again I need longer treatment I have a disease! Her response was \"give yourself more credit, you can do this but if you feel like you're going to pick up again call us and we will see what we can do!\" I laughed and said okay. The day after I left I used, overdosed, went to white deer run allenwood and found out I was pregnant. Have been trying to talk to someone their about why I wasn't tested, no one could call me back. They are a joke. I just thank God my son is perfectly fine and happy and healthy! Thanks for nothing livengrin!!"]

Why and how I gotta jump. Hoops to go see them just to get back on hormones all they care about is money Insurance and they want to say they were no longer going to see me back then when I was 24 the funny part looking back on it I should’ve let them not see me anymore because come to find out. I’m reading the feedback on here and it’s kind of making sense from my past experience I had with them I just never posted it they would always find every lame excuse to my appointment even if I’m five minutes late, it’s because they’re trying to use this place as a cash cow they don’t care to really talk to patience about their actual medical issues. I know what my situation is. I know what I want in my life and I know what I feel comfortable doing in my life. But at the end of the day they are definitely not what they used to be. They were literally giving me a hard time to having a telehealth appointment, just to reestablish as a patient because their claiming that a law is changing the way they operate. The law clearly states which I know already know what the law entails I asked them to cite it for me. Apparently they don’t know what the law is. The law states that any doctor that is seeing a patient and prescribing any medication that is either controlled substances along with other type of life altering drug. You’re supposed to physically see the doctor so they can make an actual diagnosis. I don’t mind waiting to get back on hormones. I’ve been waiting for five years when I was in Georgia but when you have people literally putting a halt to your plans for happiness and feeling like yourself more, it’s kind of becoming more of a chaotic, nuance and waste of time for me. I don’t know what’s changed about Mazzoni, but they don’t care about their patients the way they used to all they see as a cash cow in this business. There’s somebody even giving feedback about literally being billed and reported to their credit probably nonetheless because they didn’t have Medicaid anymore. If you’re gonna bring your child here, definitely make sure your child knows what is good for them I don’t even think children should be trying to transition. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to transition if that is what is right for you, but it is a life change to make a decision on. I’m happy with who I am. I don’t need the change a lot. Only thing I wanted was the better appearance of passing as a normal woman I have other medical situations that also deem me as a female. At the end of the day office did not care about their patients, including myself. Whoever Sultan is definitely does not know how to run a clinic."]

Please do not allow your family to be transported there under any circumstance#1 - At admission, they separated us and had her sign documents with out me present.  This is allowed in Pa since consent is at the age of 14.  The rules were not fully understood by my daughter who believed that she could say when she wants to leave#2 - They did not have any history about her nor did they want me to provide it.   I believe that this is rather critical in providing mental health care.  Especially when you have had support from exceptional doctors at CHOP for the past 3 years#3 - When we were finally able to talk to our daughter after about about 48 hours, we learned that they never provided her with her medication!  This is absolutely astounding and borderline malpractice.  Worse, we verbally told them the requirements at admission and we talked to the social worker at 24 hours#4 - My daughter is terrified of needles.  She requires a sedative and plenty of emotional support to get her through the process.  Still, this is an ordeal for her.  A social worker and a physician at Belmont were told this.  It is in her records.  No of that mattered.  They drew blood with out her consent and no sedative provided#5 - It took a day for them to figure out that we dropped off clothes for her.  Those were only provided after she explicitly asked for them#6 - After 36 hours, they have decided to change her diagnosis from one that was previously established over 3 years by extremely qualified doctors at Children’s Hospital.  On top of that, they want to completely change her medications.  See points #2 and #3 above.  Again, this is extremely alarmingMany of you will read bad reviews about clinics.

Our teen was very reluctant to work on her OCD and there were a couple of times we had to be bumped down on the waitlist because she refused to go. After about a year between talking with her psychologist and us she seemed ready to truly start addressing her OCDThe bad: Once we were in to the program our teen lied on the intake questionnaire so we were never able to get her the help she needed. She presented herself as not having OCD. That’s not the staffs fault but what happened next really disturbed my wife and I. Some of our teens OCD thoughts, and they are many, seem to center around sexuality. When we talked about this with the counselors and we were made to feel like “the bad guys” for bringing that up. It came across like the Rogers clinicians felt like they needed to stand up for our child against us. Her personal psychiatrist and psychologist, whom I would consider very affirming had said she’s using this as a way to not deal with her OCD. Knowing OCD and how sexuality can be a common theme how does anyone who suffers from this get help from Rogers when your counselors let their biases get in the way?One comment that stood out from a psychiatrist at a prominent PHP program elsewhere was “I'm surprised when a child comes in and identifies as straight now”. Gay people are not mentally ill but wouldn’t more mental health professionals start to wonder “Why are all the teens that need mental health help identifying on the LGBT spectrum?” It’s exploded among our teens friends, parents and society now are very affirming. For some it seems to be a way to fit in, for others it is a symptom of their greater mental health strugglesThe final insult was that the Rogers therapists wanted to refer our teen to a gender clinic. If they would have listened honestly to us we have seen a pattern of this kind of behavior from our teen, masking her OCD with other issues and using these identities as a way to fit in with one friend group when she didn’t with anotherOn top of all that with many very liberal European nations like Sweden, the UK, Norway, France and from across the globe in New Zealand and Australia backing away from adolescent surgeries and pharmaceutical therapies why on earth would you think I would ever subject my child to that?"""]

Not to discuss what brought him there, his history, or even his meds.  I've asked a couple of people to please tell the psychiatrist I would appreciate a call.  In my last conversation with my son's caseworker, who didn't really have a whole lot to say, especially when my son refused to participate in our first family session, I asked her if the psychiatrist has even evaluated my son, had diagnosed him (since so many psychiatrists come up with different diagnoses even though some of the core ones remain), if he had any recommendations yet.  She told me he had listed a  few diagnoses, none of which included the core diagnoses my son has had since he was still a toddler.  He has significant history of trauma including developmental and PTSD, yet no trauma diagnoses was made even though I gave ample history to the weekend person who called me the day after my son's arrival for his history.  I was impressed with your hospital and staff upon arrival and the one and only time I got to speak to my son for a few minutes he mentioned that he was being treated well and the food was OK.  But not hearing from the psychiatrist within my son's first week there is unconscionable and causing me to question my child's care there.  Is this standard procedure at Friends?  I have two children with significant trauma, mental, and behavioral health challenges that  have been in behavioral health hospitals many times and I've always received a call from the psychiatrists within 1 to 3 days after admission.   As a parent, I'm frustrated and disappointed.  It's never easy to send your child to one of these places and you count on professionals to work with you to support your child and you."]

She decided I was bi-polar even though I told her I had Major Depressive Disorder and did not have any manic episodes.   I signed a 72 hour notice because there were days when she was on the init but did not speak with me, when she did meet with me it was only for a minute or two.  The social worker had me sign discharge papers the day before I was going to leave.  On the day I was to be discharged the nurse asked me to come to the disk to finish my discharge papers, two other people were also being discharged.  As I spoke with the nurse Doctor Khan asked the nurse what insurance the three people had and then told her to stop the discharge paper work.  It was a Tuesday and Doctor Khan told me that if I didn't agree to stay she would take me to mental health court on Thursday.  She finally agreed to discharge me on Thursday, it wasn't a surprise that I had to track her down on Wednesday because she did not meet with me.  If she wasn't even doing anything for me why did she insist on me staying?  I told the Dicial Workerbthat I needed therapy and asked them to set me up with a place that accepted my insurance.  When I called the place the social worker referred me to I was told that they didn't accept my insurance.  So I never got help for what I really needed.

The staff are rude and nasty, and they lie to family about the care your loved one is supposed to be getting and what is made available to them.  The doctors are no better.  My son went there for help because he was suicidal and addicted to drugs and alchohol.  He was there less than 24 hours and at 8o'clock the next morning was discharged (without his signature because he refused to sign) and handed a list of drug rehabs and wished good luck.  HE WAS SUICIDAL!!!!! and they discharged him.  He wound up back there 3 days later after my husband had made all the arrangements with our health insurance provider.  Unfortunately Friends is the crisis center for Philadelphia, so we had to go there first.  I told the admitting nurse that everything was in place and authorized by our healthcare, gave her the name and contact number of the person putting everything into place and told her that she only had to make a phone call to get the chain of command rolling.  What do they do????  They tried to send him to a rehab of THEIR CHOICE instead of following what was already approved!!!!  When we fought them on it, they tried to discharge him again!!!!!  This time it didn't work.  We called the health insurance and our contact person brought the hammer down on them.

For a program that only supports youth aged 18-21 they provide very little help with issues beyond work, housing, and identification services. Their mental health treatment is as bare as possible dealing with simple issues like anxiety or depression but little for bigger issues like schizophrenia or bipolar and give little help pushing you towards a program to help support you in that aspect. As a simple homeless shelter it is pretty good with  a reasonable food schedule even though if strictly enforced. I would give this a higher score if it was simply a normal homeless shelter but as it is aimed towards younger adults and getting them off the streets they offer little support aside from finding you housing and getting you jobs, in fact they will sometimes enforce times where you cannot enter the building without a job which in my opinion defeats the purpose of getting youth off the street if your restricting them from a safe environment. For a place that helps abandoned youth transition into adulthood very little support is givenSummary: Overall it's a good homeless shelter but a subpar young adult support shelterPros:-Good rooming situations and provided washing and dryer-Access to a reliable meal schedule-Chores to teach responsibility-Provide helpful job opportunities-Good clinical help with minor mental health issuesCons:-Little assistance to major health issues (Schizophrenia, Bipolar, etc.)-Strict rules on scheduled times-Slow reception on housing opportunities together with pressured limited time shelter stay-Minor help on services beyond identification and jobs-Little encouragement of youth provided"""]

There are some nice counselors there, but the information they gave me was incorrect. One counselor did help and went out her way to make my son comfortable..

I was given WRONG Medication that helped send me to ICU on life support 16 days ago ! Then told \" they saved you \" ..bull.

I had to leave , with heart palpitating a 2 min walk took 10 to get to the front office . I was refused use of phone to call my wife & family or a cab  in all areas until I finally got up front and had to talk my way into using the phone to call a cab after being told \" No, You can't use my phone\".. More later , but Livengrin is a disgrace as far as I am concerned , they do not call you back , look up other reviews online. I had to do some \"research \" to find a few phone numbers that finally after 4 days put me in touch with the CEO, COO, Shrink and ALL Refused to listen.

[ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxbUlTclVnEAE; reviewBody; "I can not comfortably give this establishment ANY stars. It was a literal nightmare having my daughter in their care. From the beginning, the intake doctor was understanding and knew the severity of my daughter's mental health issues. My daughter was admitted on Dec. 5th. It was stated she had been off her medication for Schizophrenia for 5 months. She was 25 weeks pregnant upon admission. They admitted my daughter and did pretty much nothing for her besides watch her and feed her. They did NOT restart her anti psychotic medication for 8 days. I had to hear and watch my daughter's mental state deteriorate under their care. If you try to get a doctor on the phone with this place, you can literally FORGET IT. My mother and I constantly called and left messages with several workers on her unit who said the doctor would return our calls. We NEVER spoke with any doctors for the almost two weeks she was there. Prior to admittance, my daughter had already signed off on proper permissions to allow the doctors to communicate with my mother and I about her.  The social worker (Allison) is highly unprofessional and lacked empathy for my daughter. She offered unsolicited advice, telling my mother and I that \" She should have consulted with her ob/gyn prior to becoming pregnant about her medications\". My daughter is a mentally ill, 25 year old who doesnt have the same thought process of a woman without mental health issues so for a \"Social Worker,\" working in a profession where you are supposed to be helping and advocating for people who can not articulate for themselves is highly strange and unusual. The lack of professionalism in that remark was uncouth for a person in this field and I am appalled that she felt her judgement would change the severity of my daughter's situation. I would have respected the hospital more if they would have opted to turn away my pregnant daughter so that I could continue to search for a place who would not just \"baby sit and feed\" her but also treat the actual mental illness to get her back well. My daughter was at this facility for 8 DAYS before they finally decided to treat her psychosis. Im obliged to think they took her in to run up her insurance and do the very bare minimum for treatment and thats exactly what happened. Aside from the doctors  being completely unavailable for 13 days to discuss treatment for my daughter,  upon discharge the attending doctor prescribed my daughter a low dose of Paliperodone in the 3mg tab. They prescribed 15 tabs that needed to be cut in half and taken at bedtime. The tabs came un-scored down the middle. The pharmacy was unwilling to split the medication for my daughter and after further investigation I learned that Paliperodone is a slow releasing medication that is NOT INTENDED TO BE SPLIT and can cause severe side effects if cut. Instead of prescribing the exact pills that she took for her last 4 days in the hospital, the doctor prescribed a bigger dosage. After calling back to see if the doctor could rewrite the script to reflect 1.5 mg, dispense 30, to no avail, my daughter was in danger of missing her medication. The Charge Nurse wasnt any better as her phone etiquette reflected agitation with my mother after many days of our concerns being brushed off and no return calls from the attending doctors.  The treatment that my daughter received is indicative of the level of care they are NOT capable of delivering. This was merely an expensive bed and breakfast stay for my daughter.  A staff member was witnessed not using gloves when serving the patients food which is disgusting and unsanitary. If this hospital is afraid to treat pregnant women due to liability then maybe its a good idea to not take them into your facility from the beginning for purposes of running up their insurance. I will be filing every kind of grievance against this facility and the doctors who gave my daughter mediocre care. I am giving them 1 star because its the lowest rating I can give them on google but they deserve 0 star.  Very ghetto, HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND!"]

[ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMHZYclB3EAE; reviewBody; """1 Star:  Great if need to meet court requirement and quit later without incurring high costFinancials: you sign up and pay a co-payment.  If you are in group and one on one therapy, these expenses add up.  What most people do not realize is that the program lasts approximately 18-24 months.  Collectively you are agreeing to start a program that will indefinitely cost you THOUSANDS of $Further Lack of Clarity:  There seems to be various forms about disclosures (operations requirement), but no specifics, outline or syllabus for the program, leaving things vague.  Families are lost without directionLack of Policy:  There seems to be unclear policies at this office that change like the windLack of Support for Family: There is no support for significant others or families.  This seems strange given the reason one would start the program in the first place.  As mentioned, this is only good for the courtsMissing the Mark:  I was told if I had concerns as a spouse, I could contact someone who was not my spouses therapist  and they would relay a message.  This is clearly a tone deft practice that ignores the victim.  The worst thing you could ask someone to do is repeat themselves to strangers.  No support services were offered to me as a spouse and victim of domestic violence.  This further confirms to the victim, there is 100% nothing they can do and creates hopelessnessLicensing & Lack of True Professionals:  IF you look on the website, please note how many “LSW, social workers” appear on the website under staff.  Seeing how dangerous domestic violence is and how other mental health issues can go hand in hand, I do not believe they can direct anyone to anything else other than “talk” therapy.  No mental health evaluations are conducted.  No other treatment is referred or provided such a medicationLack of References:  No references were ever provided.  It would be nice to hear from families or past participants how the program has benefited them.  Then again, if there wasn’t any, of course this wouldn’t be offeredProgress Made in OVER 6 MONTHS:  Participants will learn why they do the things they do which seems great and exciting at first.  However, this will avail them opportunities to provide excuses to their partnersSurvey: Participants are asked to complete a survey.  I’m sorry is this not a business and are you not providing a service?  I encourage all past recipients and their spouses to write PUBLIC reviews.  They likely won’t, because it’s embarrassing to do so.  Keeping the reviews “in house” doesn’t help anyoneHusbands therapist, WHEN we worked with him, was an amazing guy limited by the lack of frame work of the program.  Issue is truly the programs lack of training of their staff and lack of organizationAdditionally,  domestic abusers tend to manipulate and lie.  Without involvement from victims, this program can go on forever without ever addressing issues.  In turn, this process can destroy familiesPlease keep in mind that few programs like this exist across the country.  The reason for this is because domestic violence rehabilitation has low success rates and is not clinically proven to stop behaviorAttend at your own riskThe Courdea website in comparison to results, feels like a diet pill infomercial that prays upon people’s deepest desires…. But hey, I hope you are the next before and after middle aged pant size dropping mom or dad."""]

She has a reputation with the residents of going out of her way to provoke discharges and causing needless antagonism, to the point of causing an autistic resident to have an extreme panic attack. She escalated this panic attack by being physically and verbally aggressive and discharged the resident for panicking, calling in paramedics to hospitalize and conduct a psych evaluation on the mentally ill adolescent whose breakdown she escalated—seemingly deliberately. The shelter’s mission of providing help to disadvantaged and homeless minority youth is not achievable with a staff member like this in their employ, as any good they do could just as easily be undone. She is at best, ableist, and at worst, malicious. Residents should never fear being made homeless again because of antagonistic staff members, and as such I cannot give a positive review."]

[ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnenRHWXBRRRAB; reviewBody; """Our loved one Vanessa Walls transitioned suddenly on Wednesday October 18. 2017, she was a Faithful, Active, Serving and Tithe paying member of  Victory Christian Center Church under the Leadership of Apostle Jimmie A. Ellis. We as her family planned to have her Celebration of Life at the church since this was her home church that she loved dearly.  To our surprise this Organization was HORRIBLE!! No one came to pray with or comfort her family. No one came to visit her 80year old mother whose daughter was faithful to their ministry. Per their website they “While providing spiritual guidance, VCC also offers a broad range of assistance and support services to meet the physical, financial, educational and emotional needs of its members and community through more than 40 church ministries and programs” WHERE?? We received a phone call on Monday October 23, 2017 from the Church Administrator Betty Liggon who stated that the date we needed was not confirmed with the church to have a Homegoing Service. Okay, fine. We then went to the church for a meeting. During this meeting we were offered no comfort, no hospitality, no prayers, tissue or even water!!This meeting seemed more of an inconvenience for the church then a help to serve the family of one of their faithful members who passed away. Did I say no one came to the house or offered prayers or condolences?? Okay back to this meeting. In the meeting we were told by Betty Liggon what the fee would be to hold the service and that she didn’t know if the church would be available, nor if they had anyone to accommodate us on that day. When the fact that no one came to the home of the deceased, Mrs Liggon stated “Oh we called, we don’t just go to people’s houses!”…Excuse me?? Okay lets move on the fact that they didn’t know who could be availible because as we were told 95% of their members WORK. Well where is the other 5%? We were then asked “Well what does the family need we will send someone out today on Monday October 23, 2017 5days after my Aunt passed. The church leadership knew of her passing on October 18 as Dr. Virginia Booth created a Facebook post. So why hasn’t this church reached out or even tried to offer any Christlike Assistance to this family!! Upon the closing of the meeting I asked If Thursday October 26, 2017 was now a confirmed date with VCC, Mrs Liggon assured us YES this is now a confirmed dateWe left the church and proceeded to go to the Funeral Home to finalize the arrangements. About 15 minutes after leaving the church we received a call from Betty Liggon (Deaconess/Church Administrator) who then told us that VCC would not be able to accommodate us to lay their member and our loved one to rest. When asked for an explanation she stated that “since the family is already displeased with the church they can’t accommodate us”. Dr. Wesley Proctor then snatched the phone and very flamboyantly stated “ WE JUST NOT GONNA TOUCH IT”….It??? IT??? IT??? You mean the home going celebration of a faithful member who pressed her WAY to Worship and Serve at this Church!!!....A faithful member who got off her sick bed against Doctors orders to come to church and worship… A faithful tithe paying member who has passed out on the street going to and from this Church!! We were TREATED HORRIBLY AS A GRIEVING FAMILY!!THERE WAS NO CHRISTIAN COMPASSION SHOWN TOWARD MY FAMILY AT ALL!!! So all of these things this Ministry states that they are is INDEED FRAUDUELNT!!! SO this is the treatment you get as a member of this “Place of Worship” when you die. THEY ARE MONEY HUNGRY AND A DISGRACE TO THE BODY OF CHRIST!!!There is more but I just dont have the energy right now!! A DISGRACE VICTORY CHRISTIAN CENTER OF PHILADELPHIA CHURCH IS!!!...If you are offened PLEASE BE VERY OFFENDED...AS A GRIEVING FAMILY WE ARE BEYOND OFFENDED...Instead of creating a resolve they as a CHURCH chose \"NOT TO TOUCH IT\" as Dr. Wesley Proctor stated!!PLEASE SHARE!!!"""]

I’ve met CEO from Horsham Clinic and Brooke Glen and they had way more personality, brains and felt more human. 2 professional staff shared they agreed with my observation of him. Fire him immediately, let patients in their rooms if they aren’t in group. Encourage showers. Hire techs with hearts who come to work to work. I observed a cruel tech throw a spoon at a patient. My grievance of this man got him suspended for something else. It’s dirty. My room was never swept or mopped. Shower rarely cleaned or filled with soap. It’s more ghetto and dirty than Kensingtons Psych ward. Boycott this place please. Make them improve standards for people who can’t speak up for themselves. I have a voice and will tell it all as I am right now. Lazy incompetent nurses too. And tell me why my entire (every single patient) on my  unit was on the medication Abilify. My mom says they throw great parties (Abilify Reps) so maybe there are kickbacks. Unethical or someone lacks training and knowledge of OTHER meds if you ask me. I signed out way before I was ready and went to a way way way better place (every place is better) in Ambler PA that always treats me well. Look that place or the one in Fort Washington up. (They are the Best in Philly areas)"]

I believe it was the last week of September 2023 I was in phili. Going through a program to help me find shelter called PATH. They tried their best they did help me a great lot. They tried having the program PAD through Salvation Army help me but the woman who work at PAD are terrible people. I’m not from the city originally and I didn’t want my kid around any bad people as in drug addicts or predators. This lady named Kavia tried calling me racist because I don’t want my daughter or my pregnant self around people who are homeless due to bad choices. Because red shield is a family shelter not a woman shelter. The kicker is if I didn’t want to wait outside with the other families they threatened me with cys. Mind you I’m pregnant and no PAD people helped me carry my belongings. Adriana said I should of spoke the way she told me when I tried finding safe shelter. Absolutely disgusting the people who work for the New Day Pad Program. Do not go to Apple Tree I went for a week straight and they didn’t help me find a shelter to be safe atThe overnight shelter I tried one time. Waited in line ahead of some regulars. They harassed me where’s my child when I went in there mind you I’m pregnant so even if I didn’t have a child who cares. They let a single man in though which is mad weirdI’m new they told me to fill out a paper and wait in this room. Meanwhile they fed regulars and didn’t come back for me. The bald headed lady who works there had the audacity to laugh in my face. Then tried telling me I can’t wait inside there for a ride. It was warm outside anyway so I went out. She’s lucky nothing happened to us because You can’t laugh at someone and be cruel like that and except people not to jump her. That’s exactly what all of us outside wanted to do because they’re nasty people running the placeRed Shield and PAD I don’t recommend I’m sorry ladies if you are in a situation like mine. It could also be that my daughter is half white and homeless or not I make sure she’s clean not dirty. So the baldy was jealous I guess 😒"""]

I drove him there today and I have never seen a more efficient set up. No lines. No wait. Everyone so efficient and kind. They didn't even have him use his walker to get to the room where the covid vaccines were being given. They gave us a wheel chair and even had a volunteer push him instead of me doing it. I had full confidence in the safety of the set up in regard to covid. Wonderful! And the protocol for giving the shots - fantastic.

The detox nurses have an EXTREMELY tough job and I felt they always gave me the best care and treated me with respect. The clinical director tried so hard to work with my probation officer to not violate me and send me upstate. Needless to say, I was extremely upset over this news and the clinical staff worked with me and help me cope with this news.  By the time I left I was accepting of my future. I learned alot. So many times in recovery we lose ourselves so much, we don't know how to get it back.  Livengrin helped me regain structure. Getting up, making your bed, keeping a clean room all plays into recovery. They were always respectful to my family and my now husband at family visits. They helped them understand addiction and what I needed.  I owe my life to Livengrin. Everyday after lunch, I'd go out into the Serenity Garden and meditate. The program there is amazing. Thanks to Livengrin I now have 26 months sober, working at a rehab, custody of my kids back and happily married. Recovery does work if you WANT IT!!!!

My child was not treated with respect or dignity. And when she got angry or voiced her concerns they deemed her aggressive and shot her with Lithium. She told them she can't take Lithium due to her history of Lithium toxicity. Since this hospital has visitation like a prison, by the time I got to my daughter's first visitation, her arms were so bruised up from all of the injections and she had a rash forming. My daughter was dope up so bad. I immediately asked to speak to a nurse who said she was not aware of my daughter's reaction to Lithium and it would be discontinued. The following day she was back to being injected. My daughter called and said they won't listen. When she protested they gave it to her anyway. I called again. My daughter, the very next day got punched in the face by another patient. I called and was told getting my daughter off the floor would be hard because they would have to find a bed. The nurse's best advice was for my daughter to stay away from the man. WHAT!!! My daughter was sitting there and this man reached out and punched her but she needs to stay away from him. I said this man has assaulted other people. I don't feel comfortable that my daughter doesn't feel safe. It's the hospital's responsibility to keep her safe. In that moment the nurse said I dont see the consent form to speak with you. I said it was signed her first day. He said well I will work on a solution to the assault issue and your daughter being safe. I will also give her a consent form so you can call back and check on her. That was on a Saturday and for 2 days my daughter asked for the form and was told we have to find one. I kept calling and being bounced from voicemail to voicemail and being smoothed over with no result. I literally had to go and sit in their lobby refusing to leave until I spoke to someone! No one even had the decency to come and talk to me. They called my cell phone. And the man who called had no updated information to give. I let him know I will not leave until I know what is going on with my child period. I'm sitting here now looking for where and how I can file a complaint against this place."]

The worst department that I had the misfortune of experiencing just recently would be the ER or Emergency Room. The intake process was fine but once I got to a room with a bed, I didn't see a nurse for more than 35 minutes. This would be understandable if the nurse was busy but she was not. I won't go into details. The doctor was condescending and skeptical of my condition. I felt so uncomfortable and unwelcomed that I ended up walking out. The nurse jokingly reminded me to come back to the ER in the future whenever I like. I immediately went to a civilian hospital where I was found to have an infection from a prostate biopsy that I received from the VAMC. Long story short, ultimately I had to stay in the hospital for a few days due to a bad infection, received some antibiotics intravenously but I  was unable to sleep for 3 days due to the persistent migraines which accompanied  my iinfection. To be fair to the VAMC Emergency Room staff, it does seem that too many hospitals have obtained a reputation for ignoring the spirit of their Professional Oath. It appears that for a profession that is the highest paid of all professions, generally speaking, many have become far too self-important and cynical in a profession that requires compassion, understanding and priority to the patient."]

The problems with this facility go beyond the time spent there. I went to therapy (out patient) once a week for about 5 months and it did not help. I originally shrugged it off assuming therapy just may not be a good treatment plan for me. A year later I am ready to see a different therapist at a different organization which has led to an annoying 2 month process of trying to get medical records forwarded along. After a month of not hearing anything I had to reach out to the office to see what the issue was, they explained the paperwork sent over from original visit at another facility was not valid and I would need to fill out theirs. 6 phone calls and two days later someone finally emails me a copy of the forms. Then I had to continuously call to check on the progress between two departments because apparently the medical release office and the out patient office don't communicate effectively with an estimate of 30 business days to have my records released. When I was finally able to speak to outpatient instead of a voice mail I was told they never received the request that was supposedly sent over a week ago. The woman out patient was able to have my stuff processed and it is said to be in transit to the other facility which would take a week or so because they don't fax things just postal sending (IN 2018?????). As soon as I think this situation is resolved I receive a $200 bill for services from a year ago out of no where. Spoke to my insurance and they explained they will be reviewing the bill again and they the facility should not be billing me directly for anything especially this far past the date of treatment.

My son (12) was placed here when he was in a bad way because there were no beds available at any other facility. It was his first hospitalization and he was terrified and hysterical. The staff were utterly devoid of compassion. They called him names. They fat-shamed him. When I questioned all of this after my son's first night, I was told the staff had a \"tough love\" approach. But that is nothing more than a blatant attempt to excuse the behavior of an unfit staff. They cursed at the children. They did nothing to stop other patients from verbal bullying or physical aggression. The staff did not get physical with my son directly but he reported they did with other children, even knocking down a disabled boy.  They also got my son's meds wrong, or rather repeatedly omitted one, despite my insistence over several days. They didn't bother giving him the personal items we brought (even though they were allowed items). I confronted one of the nurses who had shamed him for crying and she gave me some B.S. excuse for her behavior and then gave me the silent treatment in order to end the conversation. It was beyond unacceptable. I could really go on and on. My troubled son left here after a week in far worse shape than he came in. He twitched like a PTSD survivor for days afterward. I believe the psychiatry staff to be well-meaning, but the staff on the unit floor had no business working with children, and especially not mentally unstable children. My son has since been hospitalized elsewhere, and several other children related that Belmont was the worst of every facility they'd been in.

He watched a staff member bully and hit a patient with autism who could not speak. The staff members on 2 east verbally and emotionally attack patients. Cursing at them and calling them names destroying their self esteem. Not what you would want for your child that needs to heal. The male staff on 2 east provoke male teens instigate fights and bully the very clients that make their pay checks possible. Staff also steal money from patients. Paperwork said my son had money but nobody could find it in the \"safe\" when he eas discharged. Im sure staff used it for the vending machines as it was all in one dollar bills. Ive heard myself while on the phone how staff talks and refers to patients and theres no way they should be working around children especially children with mental health issues. Iam reporting this hell hole to the state. By all means do not send your loved ones there! Not sure how adult services are but this is not a mentally healthy environment"]

Nobody & nowhere is perfect. The admission process took 4ever, but I was given something decent to eat & drink. I was placed in the totally wrong unit. The D&A UNIT. I didn't, thankfully, have D&A Issues, but no beds were available anywhere else. Told I'd be moved when a bed was available. Never was. I dealt with it. I was safe. The paint was peeling, the chairs were torn up. I  still had somewhere safe to sleep, eat, shower. It was clean in my room. The woman that cleaned it daily was wonderful & very pleasant & kept our room (3 to a room) clean & well stocked w/all necessities. (Altho, I still wonder WHY U can't see out of the windows in the patients rooms??).  I met some of the most wonderful, amazing, beautiful PPL here, Learned alot about D&A issues & struggles, & could relate to almost all of them. D&A & MH issues & struggles are very similar. We all have fears, problems, (whether it be financial, family, social, legal, relationship, etc)  & deal w/\"LABELS, stigma, attitudes, Society.The staff tries their best. My Dr. was great. Straightened out my meds quickly. The staff treated me how I treated them. W/respect & kindness. Yes, they weren't always the nicest. They have alot of patients & responsibilities. 1 staff member I'd like to acknowledge is *KIMBERLY*! THANK U! U R WONDERFUL!! I was weary about being in the D&A Unit,. But got to know lots of ppl & staff. & Am so grateful to have met them. They have a wonderful Music Therapy Program, daily. Thanks to the 2 wonderful therapists that ran this group. Their playing various musical intruments and Beautiful singing was powerful and Soo beneficial to me & others. We got to really participate & share our feelings, strengths, weaknesses, hopes, etc. & Thanks to the AA & NA members who ran the meetings everyday. Thanks for sharing your stories. Even tho I wasn't on the unit I should have been on, I learned alot, was safe, gained so much wisdom about many differents issues I face daily. It's still a struggle... But it's what you make of it. Take & learn what you can from this place. I got good & bad from different staff members. They give you a ride home @discharge. If U don't have a \"home\", they try their 'best' to find you one, even if it's a homeless shelter. I realize (& I  know 1st hand), that ALOT of mental health \"Professionals\" (& other \"Professionals\" or \"Non-Professionals\" in any field) are far from \"Professional\". Report them ASAP, Have them arrested, sue them, make them lose their jobs! We all deserve to be treated fairly & humanely by everyone & everywhere we go or end up. & Make sure you give them all Ur insurance info. I'm still getting bills from them to this day. & They have all my info. So, no, I'm not paying anything that my insurance does or should."]

In theory they're supposed to call you back within 24 hours to schedule an intake appointment. In practice, I've gotten three or four voicemails 3-5 days after my messages (on days I specifically said I wouldn't be available during business hours due to my own work schedule), just telling me to call the same number again. The rest of my calls went completely unanswered. Eventually I tried calling the number for \"urgent matters,\" and the receptionist there said they can't schedule outpatient appointments and forwarded me back to the same answering machine yet again. I've even left messages asking them to just schedule me for any time on one of my days off in the next month and if they call while I'm at work to leave a message telling me the date and time of the appointment.

The Ophthalmology Department, Geriatric Department, and Coordinated Care program have combined to insure the Veteran's Administration Healthcare System has got my back. That means so much. Recently however with the new COVID-19 cautions, my experience with the routing of traffic into the Medical Center suggests a possible need for improvement. Upon turning into the usual entry, I was met with a ridiculously loud police horn. Big police presence.  I could read the sign \"EXIT\" and was obviously turning around. Yet someone behind the dark windows laid on the big horn un-necessarily. I found the entry point and proceeded through the well planned route for testing and screening for COVID-19. With clear instructions, I continued the course to an assigned  parking area quite a long hike away from building #1, my appointment location. Many veterans have mobility issues. I don't know how they are expected to get to an appointment without a shuttle of some sort.  Schlepping back from my appointment, I ran across a fellow Vietnam Veteran, a Marine.

She allowed my staff to visit the day room (I believe it was) where the men gathered to keep from being out in the cold. It was extremely intrusive and unfair to the men in that room. A few men also said some inappropriate things to my staff as they are all women. In my opinion, the tour should end before visiting that room for the safety of everyone, respect of the individuals there and to give the men who need these services privacy.

I cut short this very important hospitalization due to the facilities cleanliness, rodent issue, and NUMERIOUS concerns of mistreatment by the BHA staff to my child and other children. They curse out the children, they without consent of myself gave my child a test after we adamantly made clear that they had NO consent to have blood tests/needles since this was unnecessary during her stay, they then gave her a TB test (Which I understand is not in need of consent now) however they should have made me aware of because this was four days into her hospital stay instead of the first 24 hours of the stay which is when is should be done. Once this test was administered by staff she then had a bad mental reaction and the BHA staff then manhandled my child to subdued her to sedate her, this also happened without any paperwork submitted to her file which was admitted to me in the exit meeting as well and was to be looked into by the nursing supervisor. They also continued to given my vegetarian child meat throughout the stay as well as the basic cleanliness is just not up to standards on a child's unit.

Went somewhere else after being treated after needing dosage changesNow, having treatment for the most mundane issues takes multiple, multiple visits back and forth with little to no communication from the physician through the portal, which was all the rage 10 years agoIs this really the new generation of medical care? Playing portal tag back and forth with a physician who went on vacation and didn't forward his messages? It used to be such a nice placeToo much emphasis on pronouns rather than medicine.

The \"group therapy\" sessions were beyond unorganized. Fights would break out daily and weren't broken up quickly at all. There was little food that could be considered edible in the cafeteria. One of the nurses overdosed me which left me with a dangerously low blood pressure for the entire day. This made me unable to leave my bed without passing out. They refused to bring up food for me the entire day and refused to send me back to the ER. We were treated like cattle, it was a rare occasion that you could even look out the window. Not to mention at the time, I identified as a trans boy. Instead of being supportive I was frequently demeaned and questioned about my identity. On my sheet it said I was sent for a \"med fix\", but the entire time I was there, there wasn't a single medication that was modified. When I expressed my concerns to my mother and the staff, they threatened to AMA me if I did not stay. It did more damage to me than anything and I wouldn't even send my worst enemy there. Nobody deserves to be treated like this. IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR LOVED ONE, DON'T SEND THEM THERE IF YOU EVER WANT THEM TO GET BETTER."]

Was placed in a shelter with in a month and a half, did not like the shelter I was put into it was extremely hot even with windows open and room fans they put the heater up way to high my hands and feet was burning during the winter I went, my son that is 1yd did not like their food he fussed and cried I had to just give him more milk that they also provided. The shelter was nothing like I thought I had to share a room and she was nasty no matter the complaints from staff they also don’t aloud you to use your floor bathrooms during certain times of the day so your forced to use a real nasty rest room, and the baby changing table was above a radiator so the table was super hot to hot to place your baby. The shelter does not help with any personal needs they give you one toilet paper to use and from then on out you have to support your own. They do not have washer or drier there you have to walk to a laundry mate with your child and clothes, I wasn’t there long enough to wash clothes. They don’t provide any rags or towels no one told me that. They do not provide any place your child can nap in peace your not aloud in your room certain times of the day. They do not provide any snacks just 3 meals for the day and your not aloud to bring in outside food at a certain time. Most people who go in in the beginning have a curfew of 9pm.

I had to ask him what the procedures are there for some clarity on what was going on.  Only then did he explain the process, almost as if he didn't really feel like putting in the extra effort if I hadn't asked him. The facilities are very dirty and shabby. The initial waiting room for intake was two benches.  and a VERY small room, so we had to see all of the other patients coming in as well while we waited anxiously to be seen by the doctor. Luckily our patient was admitted but calling back through the Crisis Response Center, I had to wait a LONG time for someone to be able to pick up.  A few times I called I was not directed to the proper unit or the case manager.  Another worker, a security guard, gave me his phone number and told me to call him. VERY inappropriate.  And all of the security guard, intake med techs were staring at me, like hitting on me with their eyes.

They said they would discharge me but at the last minute the psychiatrist told me I’d have to stay another week for no particular reason at all I was well behaved was there for 14 days.

They did not attempt to contact my insurance company until 13 hours after I had been admitted to the hospital. I spent 17 hours in a sitting position in a brightly lit room with a blaring television looping infomercials at top volume (two major migraine triggers for me)  without my medications,  further irritating some of my physical ailments and completely pushing me to my emotional limitations. I went to the hospital because I was very far off from being well and by the time I was brought to the room I would be staying in I was much worse off physically, mentally and emotionally than when I showed upThe treatment team that I had was less than willing to work with me towards any positive treatment goals and I was told by the unit psychiatrist that they would not be able to help me there but would not release me until I signed a 72 order and completed those 72 hours in the unit. I was without most of my medications to manage multiple physical issues. Getting my psych. medications was also an issue for the first several days, my medication for anxiety and PTSD was never addressed causing me to be in a complete state of panic for the time that I was inpatient (7 days). The medical staff was non-existent in helping me with addressing my medical problems (had surgery right before going inpatient). I was physically ill the majority of time that I was there and getting Imodium to address those issues took over 24 hours for approval and getting them added to my chartGroup therapy was limited to movement and musical therapy. Two things I could not do, because of the recent surgery and the migraine I was experiencing and unable to get medication forThe whole time I was there I was in more pain, physically, mentally and emotionally. Everything about what they do in regards to caring for people with mood and mental disorders needs to be reevaluated as they are doing more harm than good to a very vulnerable population."""]
